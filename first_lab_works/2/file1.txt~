SHELL PROGRAMMING
1.
Write a script to continually monitor all running processes and to keep 
track of how many 
childprocesses each parent spawns.  If  a process spawns more than  five  children, then the 
script  sends  ane
-
mail  to  the  system  administrator  (or 
root
)  with  all  relevant  information, 
including the time, PID ofthe parent, PIDs of the children
, etc. The script appends a report 
to a log file every ten minutes.
2. 
Write  a  script  to  check  and  validate  passwords.  The  object  is  to  flag  "weak"  or  easily 
guessedpassword  candidates.A  trial  password  will  be  input  to  the  script  as  a  command
-
line 
paramet
er.  To  be  consideredacceptable,  a  password  must  meet  the  following  minimum 
qualifications:
• Minimum length of 8 characters
• Must contain at least one numeric character
• Must contain at least one of the following non
-
alphabetic characters: @, #, $, %, &,
*, +, 
-
, 
=
• Do a dictionary check on every sequence of at least four consecutive alphabetic characters 
inthe password under test. This will eliminate passwords containing embedded "words" 
foundin a standard dictionary.
3. 
Write a script that calculates determinants by recursively expanding the 
minors
. Use a 
4x
4determinant as a test case.
