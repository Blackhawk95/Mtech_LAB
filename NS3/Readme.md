Lab 1

Consider a IEEE802.11 saturated network with single Access Point (AP). Deploy the
stations randomly around an AP. If the station fails to receive ACK for n ack =2, then that
station suffers from hidden terminal problem. The hidden station broadcasts “Warning
signal” and decreases its Carrier Sensing Threshold (CST) by step size upto the minimum
CST. Measure the collision rate, end-to- end delay and PDR by varying the number of
stations.
Input: Number of stations
Output: Collision rate, PDR, end-end delay

Lab 3

Simulate Ethernet LAN with N nodes. Implement congestion control algorithm using
fast retransmission, and measure PDR and PLR. Plot the congestion window over time.
Input: Number of nodes (N)
Output: PDR, PLR
